								I've worked on a variety of projects over the

								Many of these projects are open-source and
								available for others to explore and contribute

								I've worked on, please feel free to check out

								Collaborating with others is a great way to
								learn and grow, and I'm always open to new ideas

								<br />
								In addition to these open-source projects, I've
								also had the privilege of working on several
								confidential projects for enterprise clients.
								These projects have allowed me to gain valuable
								experience in building scalable and secure web
								applications that meet the unique needs of each
								client. If you're interested in learning more
								about my work on enterprise projects, please
								feel free to reach out to me directly.
